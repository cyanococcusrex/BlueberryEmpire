<p>Hot off the presses.  For the youngsters in the audience, "presses" 
is a reference to printing presses, which were like the smartphone of 
the sixteenth century.  And hotter is better, because it means fresher.  
It's cinnamon roll rules.</p>

2018/08/04 - Added title screen for <i>Transit of the Cosmotic</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/08/03 - Changed name of game to <i>Chylde Norrick atop Bucreus 
Arydnge</i> and added a draft title screen that's basically a collage of 
the Bayeux Tapestry.  There's so much medieval flavour in there now
that we really have to reverse the word order: "flavour medieval".
</p>

<p>
2018/04/21 - Added title screen for <i>Ascension Run</i>.  It doesn't 
really quite capture the feeling of apotheosis we were going for, or at
least not yet.  But in our defense, apotheosis is really hard to draw.
</p>

<p>
2018/04/15 - Added "Store" page, but no actual store yet.  We'd like to 
say it was added as a Zen exercise, but in reality we just can't quite 
figure out how to hook everything up yet.  Also, changed name of game to
<i>Childe Norrick atop Bucreus Ariding</i>, for even more of that 
medieval flavor we mentioned earlier.  Heck, at this rate, we may have to
start spelling it "flavour".
</p>

<p>
2018/04/09 - Added title screen for <i>Tranquillitatis</i>.  We cheated 
somewhat by using a real moon.
</p>

<p>
2018/04/08 - Added title screen for <i>Iconoclast</i>.  It's bleak-lookin'.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/31 - Changed name of game to <i>Childe Norrick and Bucreus</i>,
for that medieval flavor.  Added title screens for <i>ConWijCo</i> and
<i>William the Thundrous</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/29 - Added title screen for <i>Freakybomb</i>.  Added <i>Sir 
Norrick and Bucreus</i> and <i>Ye Ettin's Head</i> to names-only section.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/28 - Added title screen for <i>Dawnstar Station</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/27 - Added title screen for <i>Halls of Aeolus</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/25 - Added new game, <i>Blast Shadow</i>, and its logo.  Added 
title image for <i>Bing-Bang and the Brickbats</i>.  Added flavor text
for <i>Iconoclast</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/23 - Tweaked flavor image for <i>Folddrive</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/22 - Changed name of game to <i>Folddrive</i>, because the old 
name was already taken, apparently.  Also changed the name in this log
retroactively, because people sue people for almost anything now, and 
changed this log entry retroactively to reflect the retroactive change. 
Whew!  Our memory hole has been getting such a workout latetly, it's 
getting clogged up.  We should have sprung for the deluxe Eastasian model.  
We have always been at war with this Eurasian one.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/17 - Added "title screen" section.  Cleaned up some logos. 
Added title screens for <i>Adductor Wing</i> and <i>Advanced Laser Pragmatics</i>.
Added <i>Ascension Run</i> to the names-only section.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/15 - Added logo for <i>Bing-Bang and the Brickbats</i> and promoted
it to the logo section.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/14 - Added flavor text for <i>Dawnstar Station</i>.  Added logo and 
flavor image for <i>Folddrive</i>.  Promoted <i>Adductor Wing</i> up to 
logo section.</p>
</p>

<p>
2018/03/12 - Replaced <i>Hot Plate Cuidado</i> with <i>ConWijCo</i>.  
Added flavor text for <i>ConWijCo</i> and <i>Freakybomb</i>.
</p>

<p>

2018/03/10 - Added some flavor text for the games <i>Adductor Wing</i>,
<i>Advanced Laser Pragmatics</i>, and <i>Hell in Space</i>.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/09 - Added a few more logos.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/06 - Added a bunch of pages for a bunch of games.  Most of them
are just logos at this point.  Also, not all of them even have logos.  
It'll be okay.
</p>

<p>
2018/03/04 - A redesign of the site is in progress.  As that guy on
that show once said, let's do this now and let's never regret it.
