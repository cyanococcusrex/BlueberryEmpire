Praise?  Yes, please.  Questions?  We're here to help.  Comments?  
Let's hear 'em.  Complaints?  Yeah, we're gonna get some of those.  
Crazy, angry threats?  Uhm, well, those are not... ideal, but I guess 
if you just can't help it, we might as well get the paper trail rolling 
on that.

Although, those addresses will probably have to change now that we've 
posted them for every pill-peddler on the internet to 
spam.  If you don't get a snappy response, maybe try, uh... 
feedback2@blueberryempire.com?  Oh, wait, now that one's gonna get 
spammed to death, too.  Hmm, this is tricky.
