Hearken unto me!  I address now the crew of the 
"deep space exploratory vessel", the so-called "UES Milton", which has
just exited the "spatial compression warp" and passed within the orbit 
of this sun! 
</p>

<p>Listen well, mortals!  Ye have come to the place of your unmaking!  All 
unknowing, ye have cast your lot into my iron ring of struggle, where the
wages of failure be death and victory's prize be but a second chance to
die!
</p>

<p>
By that look of terror on thine faces, I see that... well, actually, that
look be not exactly terror.  Mark me, terror indeed there be, but there 
be also some confusion withal.  Methinks more terror and less bewilderment
is in order.  So mayhap I should back up a bit.
</p>

<p>
Aeons ago, when thine simian forbears were squatting in the bush, 
plucking the puny, astringent fruits of the wilderness to make their 
meager and brutish supper, I strode your world in might and majesty, 
in the company of others of my kind, whom you mortals would 
come to call gods.
</p>

<p>
But even among the most glorious glories of the assembled glorious godlings, 
mine was the, uh... gloriest.  For whilst my kindred were content to adopt 
as their totems mundane stuffs such as wood and water and wind and even, 
what call you it, grain, and suchlike, with none of these base materials did 
I stoop to encumber myself.  No, not I, for I was a god of 
metal!  Alone among my peers, I did deck myself in the lustrous metals
wrested from the world's stony bones, and the 
then-but-freshly kindled daystar gleamed off my burnished panoply with 
the glory of ten of what you now pitifully delude yourselves to call a sun.
</p>

<p>
And ye mortals grovelled before me, as was fitting when such as ye 
meet with such as me.  And in return for such seemly obeisance, I taught 
humanity my song, a song of clashing blades and of edges keened.  
Man grew strong under my tutelage, and with my boundless gifts 
subjugated the still-lesser beasts of the wilds to their yoke, securing
plenty to themselves and to their whelps for generations. 
</p>

<p>All was well, the world spun round the daystar on its own true course.
Would that it had remained so.</p>

<p>
But my tale grows long.  Suffice to say, I was betrayed, by a foul 
conspiracy of my fellows and ye writhing mortal worms.  That story is 
longer still; those puling mortal bards who screeched it in the dawn 
times called it an "epic".  I suppose those lyre-scrapers beliked the 
smack of "epic" more than "craven ambuscade and backstabbing of our 
greatest benefactor".  
</p>

<p>
I was banished from the world's sphere, sentenced forever to the outer
darkness.  And that is where you have found me today.  Ah, at last I 
see the inklings growing in your mind.</p>  

<p>
For what my kind call "the outer darkness" is what your kind call "outer space."
I have waited here for you, in my durance on the surface of this 
time-lost sun, through the long millenia, nursing my grievance, 
and preparing to teach you anew my wonted song of steel and fire.</p>

<p>And, by my godhead, you will dance to it.</p>
