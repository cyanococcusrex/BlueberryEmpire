Hey, Slugger.  It's your old uncle Boovortz.  Remember me?  
<br /><br />

Well, if you
do, go ahead and forget about me.  Because if you're hearing this message, 
it means that I haven't hit the snooze button on my deadman's switch 
within the last ten days.  
<br /><br />

Best case, it could be because I'm currently steeping in my own juices, 
up to my blowhole in the greatest vacation of my life, whacked outta my 
braincase on those fruity little drinks that come with the little solar
shield in them, whattya-call-em, Solar Prominences? and passed out 
somewhere on the glittering sands under the glittering lights of the 
Arconis Microstellar Swarm.  Heck, since we're optimisticizing here, 
maybe I finally managed to remember the quantum resonance code to the 
pocket dimension that sucked in that female I met on Spring Break forty 
cycles ago.  Of course, I guess she might not be as interested in me 
now that I've got this bloated argolith bladder and receding finline. 
<br /><br />

Second-best case, I could have transcended this plane of reality.  I 
know, that sounds a little donky-twonky for me, but it's possible.  See, 
I know this guy--Allorlollorlolo--I call him Lo.  Lo's got, like, serious hair, 
and you can't depend on him for much of nothing much of anybody considers
worth much of anything, but if you ever need a quick escape what he calls 
this "mundane sphere of deeds and facts", he's your wheel man. 
<br /><br />

Worst case, it's also possible I've been "elided from spacetime".  
I got into some trouble with the Time Mafia once/always, and while I'm pretty sure
that caper ended/began with the Time Mafia not ever having existed to begin with, 
apparently it's not uncommon for these trans-reality deals to kind of
come unstuck, and there's always a long-term risk of what Lo calls 
"reentrant metaphysics", so maybe the Time Mafia Prime or something 
finally/initially caught up with me.  Or me with them, I never went to 
time college.
<br /><br />

The upshot is, you've just come into some property, sonny.  It's a little 
space station called Dawnstar.  The property itself is not much to look 
at, but you know what the reality estate salesbeings say--spacetime locus,
spacetime locus, spacetime locus.  And Dawnstar's sitting right on top
of one honey of a spacetime locus.  See, it's its own sovereign country.
Or rather, it isn't, but it sits approximately on the border between the 
Altrax Protectorate, the To'o'naaaaaa Empire, the SHZZ-KZZZ territorial
hunting grounds, and the Unconfederacy of the Insistently Nonaligned.  
I say it's "approximately" on the border because about forty-five cycles
ago the station's topologizer went a little too long without a service 
call and stretch-puckered 
the whole sector into a Klein Bottle for a while.  The Altraxi cleaned 
it up as best they could, because they're neat-freaks, but afterwards 
no one was really sure where the border is anymore, and so far no one's 
been willing to reignite the Tetrapartite War to lay claim 
to it.  Nowadays they call the whole mangled mess "the Dawnstar Derangement".  
<br /><br />

Cut to about fifteen cycles ago, when I won her in a game of Cards.  
Like, literally, the game was just called "Cards".  Also, that same 
night I became a Viscount.  Though I think that may have been unrelated.
<br /><br />

Anyway, now I guess I'm dead.  So Dawnstar is yours now, kid.  Congrats, 
you're a homeowner, and maybe even a Viscount.  The access codes should 
be in the same spaceport locker where you found the messajector this 
message is playing on.  Which
reminds me, feed my chronomackerel.  Don't worry, he's not a fussy pet--
he breathes time and only needs to be fed once every -13i rotations.
<br /><br />

Oh, and then you'll probably want to hurry over to Dawnstar,
because the one thing all four sides of the Tetrapartite War seem to agree
on is that whichever one of them can kill you first can legally take
possession of the Dawnstar Derangement.  Unless I miss my guess, there
may be a few assassins on your tail already.  
<br /><br />

So duck and cover, Junior,  Tuck and roll.  Don't trust any mysterious 
points of laser light.  Good luck, and may the Unbounded Qualpu overlook 
thy transgressions. 
<br /><br />

He sure as heck has overlooked his share of mine.<br />
