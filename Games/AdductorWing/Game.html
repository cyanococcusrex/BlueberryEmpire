The sentients of Neevix 4 have really been getting civilized lately.  
In the last few centuries, they've evolved beyond all manner of cultural 
bad habits, including slavery, a Neevix-4-centric cosmological model, 
prejudice based on physical appearance, systematic mass killings of 
sentients, a.k.a. "warfare", and, recently, plastics.

<p>
Yep, by any objective 
standard, they've really done their ancestors proud, though of course 
their ancestors would probably disagree, partly because that's just how 
ancestors are, and partly because the ancestors were the ones who came 
up with all the cultural bad habits in the first place.  But again, by 
objective standards, gold star.
</p>

<p>
The Neevixians' most recent civilizational milestone is the establishment
of first contact with extra-Neevixian life.  And it's been going... well, 
to be perfectly candid, it hasn't been going super great so far.
</p>

<p>
There's been less open exchange of ideas than hoped.  In fact, there's 
been no talking of any kind so far.  So far, there's mostly just been 
kidnapping.  There's been more fire and exposed circulatory fluid than 
is generally considered desirable, too.  And, to add insult to injury,
whenever an alien ship tears off into the night sky with a fresh load of 
Neevixian loved ones to do who knows what with, they tend to leave a 
significant amount of plastic behind.
</p>

<p>
Diplomacy has failed (as has a somewhat lower-priority recycling 
awareness drive).
</p>

<p>It may be time to dust off some of those old bad habits.</p>

<p>Specifically, the systematic-mass-killing-of-sentients one.</p>

<p>It's a shame.  But hopefully the next neighbors will be nicer.</p>
