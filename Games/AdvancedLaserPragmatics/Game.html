Subject: help?<br />
<br />
Hey, quick question: Is anyone in the facility still alive?  
<br /><br />
If so, we could really use some help in the Emerging Energetics lab.  As
most of you know, our department recently had their headcount reduced,
and I don't want to drag out that old argument again, but as I warned 
in the budget meetings, it's really starting to affect our work.
<br /><br />
I'm talking about the figurative headcount reduction here, not a literal
one, by the way.  So if any of you were hesitant to help out because 
of that, don't be.  I mean, we all remember that Jim was very tall.  
Most of us wouldn't have had the same issue.
<br /><br />
Anyway, partly due to our chronic understaffing, there's been a... well, 
I don't want to say "transdimensional 
rift" and panic everyone, but the situation or situations 
down here definitely have some-rift like qualities, and it would be fair
to say there are at least five and possibly up to 20 dimensions involved.
So there's that.  Stan, I know you're immediately going to want to
know EXACTLY how many dimensions.  I'm sorry, we're slammed at the 
moment, if you want to know you're going to have to come down here and 
count them yourself.
<br /><br />
Actually, never mind.  I just now got some new information, and a lot more
of my insides are on the outside, and I think I won't need any help after
 all.  Maybe just head for the exits, if you see any exits that aren't 
clogged up.
<br /><br />
Tell my wife I love her.  Tell Stan's wife I love her too.  And I guess 
I should finally tell Jim's wife sorry, since most of the legal 
department is currently phased halfway through my office's ceiling, and 
the twitching has stopped.  Hey, how's that old joke go?  "A good start"?
<br /><br />
Hoping you're not all dead already,
<br /><br />
Myron Artiss
