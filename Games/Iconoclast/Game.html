With regard to current events, what are they?  Why is all my housing destroyed?  Huh?

It is explainable.  A disaster has sat down on us.

We are one hundred percent sat upon.  The disaster was that someone opened
the icon.</td>

The icon, is this what you are saying?  Of course, the icon is well-known, 
and requires no further description.  But how is opening the icon a
disaster?  Wasn't the icon designed for opening?

<table><tr>
<td class="speechBubble">Yes, but this opening was not 
undertaken in the recommended manner.  The wrong opening has pushed the 
icon into negative state.  Consequently, now we are all in negative 
state.</td>

Exceptional!  Does this building contain exciting prototypes of speedy jet-powered
aeroplane designs, with adaptive weaponry and stealthy approach and 
avoidance technologies?

It does very.  Badly, the location of this building is known by 
the icon itself completely, and by others less so.

At this time, I invite you into the sewers underlying our city, and 
propose that we live within them, and make many daughters and sons, and
so on, until a hero is gradually born who can close the icon and bring
forth positve state.
