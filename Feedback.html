Praise?  Yes, please.  Questions?  We're here to help.  Comments?  
Let's hear 'em.  Complaints?  Yeah, we're gonna get some of those.  
Crazy, angry threats?  Uhm, well, those are not... ideal, but I guess 
if you just can't help it, we might as well get the paper trail rolling 
on that.

If you'd like to get in touch, just email:

<p>feedback@blueberryempire.com</p>

Although, that address will probably have to change now that we've 
posted it on the internet for every pill-peddler on the internet to 
spam.  If you don't get a snappy response there, maybe try, uh... 
feedback2@blueberryempire.com.  Oh, wait, now that one's gonna get 
spammed to death, too.  Hmm, this is tricky.
